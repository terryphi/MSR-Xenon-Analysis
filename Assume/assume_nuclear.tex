\subsection{Considerations in Nuclear Pathway}
Prior xenon analysis assume the $^{135}Te \rightarrow ^{135}I \rightarrow ^{135}Xe$ decay pathway is the only means through which xenon may enter the system.  Firestone shows the A=135 decay pathway beginning with Sb-135, with a 1.71 s half-life and 0.145\% thermal fission yield from U-235. \cite{Firestone96} Firestone also reports Xe-135 production has been observed in (p,d) and (d,t) reactions; however, these production modes have also been assumed negligible.  Activation of Xe-135 into Xe-135m has also been been ignored, although Chu reports Xe-135 activation may occur both with thermal and fast neutrons. \cite{Chu1999}
