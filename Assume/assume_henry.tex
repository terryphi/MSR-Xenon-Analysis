\subsection{Isothermal Henry's Constant}
Henry's constant is a function of temperature of a single temperature.  In Robbins Static Headspace method to determine Henry's constant, a constant temperature bath was used to keep both the liquid and gas being measured in isothermality with each other.  \cite{Robbins1993}  MSR graphite is subject to both heat transfer with the salt as well as radiative heating from gamma and neutron sources. ORNL-TM-0378 reports a steady state difference in graphite and fuel salt temperature in the MSRE on the order of 30 K. \cite[P. 42]{ORNLTM378}  Information on the effect of non-isothermal gas and liquid phases on Henry's constant was not found.  Prior analyses have assumed this difference to be negligible, and a single, temperature invariant, Henry's constant was used.
