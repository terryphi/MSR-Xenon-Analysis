\subsection{Well Mixed Fuel Salt}
Both Eades and Wu have developed one-dimensional models of MSR xenon poisoning. \cite{Eades16,Wu2017} Eades split his a 1D MSR model into in-core and out-of-core equations, and found that the zero-dimensional model agrees with the 1D model. Wu found that at low power, fuel salt circulation decreases I-135 and Xe-135 concentration up to 50\%. In the ORNL-4069 the fuel-salt was assumed to act as a well stirred tank for xenon. \cite[p. 21]{ORNL4069} The same assumptions was made for ORNL-TM-3464. \cite[p. 6]{ORNLTM3464}  These assumptiosn are justified on the condition,
\begin{equation}
    t_{1/2}^{Xe} >> t_Circ.
\end{equation}
This condition may not also be true for Te-135 with its 19s half-life; however, Te-135 has no substantial impact on reactor neutronics, and the condition certainly holds for its successor, I-135.
